## 🧠 Payment Mode & UPI Thought Process

The app allows users to select a **Payment Mode**:
- Cash
- UPI
- Card

Currently, all expenses are added manually.  
However, the structure is intentionally designed so that **UPI expenses can be auto-tracked in the future**, while cash expenses remain manual — similar to real-world finance apps.

> Due to RBI and NPCI restrictions, direct UPI access is not allowed in web apps.  
> Future integration can be done using SMS parsing, email parsing, or Account Aggregator APIs.
