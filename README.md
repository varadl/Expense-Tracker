# 💸 Expense Tracker Web App (Practice Project)

A **responsive Expense Tracker web application** built as a **practice project** to strengthen skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The focus of this project is **DOM manipulation, UI design, localStorage usage, and basic data visualization**.

This project is intended for **learning and portfolio demonstration**, not for real financial usage.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add, ✏️ edit, and ❌ delete expenses  
- 💾 Persistent data using **LocalStorage**
- 📊 Category-wise expense visualization using **Chart.js**
- 💳 Track expenses by **Payment Mode** (Cash / UPI / Card)
- 📅 Clear expense date handling (no ambiguity)
- 📱 Fully responsive UI (mobile & desktop)
- 🎨 Clean UI with hover effects and smooth interactions

## 🧠 Learning & Design Intent

This project was created to **practice frontend fundamentals**:

- Structuring web pages using **HTML5**
- Building responsive layouts with **CSS3**
- Handling user input and UI updates with **JavaScript (ES6)**
- Storing and retrieving data using **localStorage**
- Displaying data visually using **charts**

### 💳 Payment Mode Logic (Conceptual)
The app includes a **Payment Mode selection**:
- Cash
- UPI
- Card

All expenses are **manually entered**.  
The structure is intentionally designed to **simulate real-world finance apps**, where:
- Cash expenses are manual
- Digital transactions (UPI/Card) could be auto-tracked in future systems

⚠️ Due to **RBI & NPCI restrictions**, direct UPI access is **not possible in web apps**.  
Real-world solutions typically use **SMS parsing, email parsing, or Account Aggregator APIs**.

This logic is included **for learning and system-design understanding only**.
